# Fracture Care (Surgery Residency) Education Tool

## Intro

The FCET is intended to teach and assess fixation of femoral neck fracture for Yale's surgeons in residence. It has been created with advice from trauma care surgeons at Yale University's Department of Orthopaedics and Yale New Haven Hospital.

## Download

See the [latest release](https://github.com/ancinape/fracture-care-education-tool/releases/latest) to download this tool. The tool is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux computers.

## Reasoning
The tool was created as part of a spearhead into research of digital training tools in medicine and their effectiveness onto students and residents. The FCET is one such tool, designed to instruct surgeons in residence on the proper placement of screws in a fixation of a femoral neck fracture. It is meant to be used before watching a recorded lecture about the surgery (created by William McLaughlin) as a pre-test then assessing oneself again with the post-test. Both are virtually identical tests except the pre-test reveals the ideal screw positions.

## Controls

Once you position your screws, click "Assess".
You have 3 attempts in total.

### Camera Controls:

Hold right-click and move mouse to rotate camera

Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out

### Screw controls:

Left-click on a screw to see the gizmo

Left-click and hold on any end of the gizmo to move the screw

While the gizmo is visible:
	Press 1 to see the transformation gizmo
	Press 2 to see the rotation gizmo

## Assessment

When one feels the screws are appropriately positioned, they can be assessed for placement accuracy. To assess for accuracy, one should press the "Assess" button on the top left. The tool will respond with how many screws are properly placed out of 3. The ideal score is 3 out of 3 screws. The worst score is 0 out of 3 screws.
